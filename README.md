#Number Guesser in React
> A number guessing game built in React

##Goal:
The goal of this project was to get our first introduction to using a React framework. We rebuilt a previous project that allows a user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. If a user guesses the correct answer the range of numbers to guess between increases by 20. A user can also input his or her own range of numbers to guess between. This project provided great experience in updating and saving state in React.


##Built With:
* React
* HTML
* Sass
